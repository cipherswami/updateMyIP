# UPDATE MY IP

This project is designed to monitor IP address changes on a system and automatically send updates to a remote server. It integrates seamlessly with our web login system at [INTENT Labs](https://github.com/intentlab-iitk/intentlab-iitk.github.io), allowing you to securely view your current IP address on the website.

Whether you're managing a lab network or simply want to keep track of your device's IP changes, this tool provides a reliable and automated solution.

## Prerequisites

- As of now support is avialble only for Linux systems with `systemd`.

## Installation [Linux]

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/intentlab-iitk/updateMyIP && cd updateMyIP
    ```

2. **Set Up Your Password**

    Before proceeding with the installation, you must set your password in the `updateMyIP.sh` script.

    ```bash
    nano linux/updateMyIP.sh
    ```

    Locate the line with `ACTUAL_PASSWORD="PASSWORD_HERE"` and replace `"PASSWORD_HERE"` with your web login password.

    Save and close the file (`CTRL+S`, `CTRL+X`).

3. **Run the Installation Script**

    ```bash
    sudo linux/install.sh
    ```

    This script will:
    - Copy the IP monitoring script (`updateMyIP.sh`) to `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/`.
    - Make it executable.
    - Restart NetworkManager to apply changes.

    Installation is complete! If you encounter any problems, check the logs using the [Debugging](#debugging) section below.

    ```

2. **Run the uninstallation script**

    ```bash
